initial installer:

2) pin all browsers you wish to use onto the taskbar
3) open the folder named "clicker" on the desktop and double-click clicks.py and follow the prompts in the box

to utilize the VPN switch:
4) retrieve the username and password from your VPN provider FOR YOUR OPENVPN CLIENT. (this is not the same sign in information that you use for the VPN service itself)
5) download all available openvpn files from your vpn provider place them all into C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config

the script will require initial callibration, this will be prompted on the commandline , please watch the tutorial video:
to calibrate:
1) when prompted open the browser youre calibrating
2) maximize it
3) alt-tab into the dialog screen and size it so that you can see all of the buttons you are looking to calibrate in the background, OR ON ANOTHER SCREEN IF MORE THAN 1 DISPLAY
4) move the cursor directly over the prompted button, do not click anything, press enter, and follow the next dialog, you will repeat this ~13 times per browser calibration
5) after all prompts for that browser, close the browser, return to the dialog box, and either choose to incorporate more browsers if previously chosen

after the calibration settings are made for a particular browser they are saved and you can bypass this step on your next uses.
